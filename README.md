# Shipping Status Checker

## Project Description
- A Python script that checks the shipping status of Amazon orders in the last 6 months by scraping the shipping information from an Amazon profile. The program processes a .csv file containing order details, updates it with the current status, and makes it easy to track multiple orders at once.
